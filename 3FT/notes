I think FT_findNode should have a checker for files and directories
and we can add an argument that differentiates if we are looking for a
file or directory. (0 for directory, 1 for file)

have to fix Node_getType and access it only when we can, handle corner cases
whenever looking at children, check if it is file or directory.

insertFile 
    - actions inside while loop happen at evey level
    - we just want to insert file at end of oppath. 


do we have to allocate memory for file contents and size? 

for getlength, getcontents, changefile, do we have to check if it is a file?
