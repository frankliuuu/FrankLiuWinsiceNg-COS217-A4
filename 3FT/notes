I think FT_findNode should have a checker for files and directories
and we can add an argument that differentiates if we are looking for a
file or directory. (0 for directory, 1 for file)

have to fix Node_getType and access it only when we can, handle corner cases
whenever looking at children, check if it is file or directory.

insertFile 
    - actions inside while loop happen at evey level
    - we just want to insert file at end of oppath.
